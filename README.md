# C-mini-project-template

This is a basic demo template for a simple C or C++ project, mainly for students who are just starting to learn C/C++.

## Usage 

1. In the `Makefile` specify the language you want to use via the `LANG` variable, also adjust the compiler `CC` accordingly

2. `/src` is for the source filers and `/include` for the header files

## Note 

This is really meant more for people just starting to work with C/C++ who maybe want to have a more clean project structure. This does not scale to more complex projects, for that you might want to look at better build tools or improve this setup.

I included some demo files in the `/src` and `/include` folder.
